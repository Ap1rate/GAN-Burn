# Burn Wound ROI Detection and GAN-based Pseudo-Thermal Map Synthesis

This repository contains the implementation of our pipeline for **burn wound detection and pseudo-thermal image generation**, developed for **academic research and paper submission**.  
The project integrates **YOLOv11** for automatic Region of Interest (ROI) detection and a **GAN model (Swin-Unet Generator + PatchGAN Discriminator)** for generating pseudo-thermal representations, which are used to approximate burn depth estimation.

Our GAN framework is based on **pix2pix**, extended with a **Swin-Unet backbone** for enhanced feature extraction and contextual understanding.  
To stabilize training and encourage structural consistency, we introduce a **Gradient Consistency Loss** in addition to the standard L1 and adversarial objectives.  
This design allows the generator to synthesize heat-map-like pseudo-thermal outputs from the refined burn wound ROIs.

The workflow begins with **YOLOv11 detection** of burn wound regions, followed by manual refinement of the cropped ROI for ground truth generation.  
The generator then learns to translate the cropped ROI into pseudo-thermal maps that align with expert-verified burn severity references.  
This combination provides a feasible pipeline for **non-contact burn assessment** using only smartphone-captured images.

## Methodology Overview

- **YOLOv11 Model**  
  Detects bounding boxes for burn areas from raw clinical or smartphone-captured images.  

- **ROI Refinement**  
  Experts adjust and validate the wound boundary, generating high-quality inputs for GAN training.  

- **GAN (Swin-Unet + PatchGAN)**  
  - *Generator*: Swin-Unet with multi-scale feature extraction.  
  - *Discriminator*: PatchGAN for local texture realism.  
  - *Losses*: Adversarial loss + L1 loss + Gradient Consistency loss.  

- **Outputs**  
  Pseudo-thermal burn maps that approximate tissue damage severity.
